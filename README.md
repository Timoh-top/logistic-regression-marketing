# logistic-regression-marketing
Predicting marketing campaign term deposit subscriptions using logistic regression
# Project Overview
This project uses logistic regression to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on the Bank Marketing Dataset. It demonstrates EDA, data cleaning, preprocessing, handling class imbalance, model training, evaluation, and interpretation, showcasing practical supervised machine learning skills.
# Techniques Used
Data Cleaning & Exploration (EDA)
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling
Train-test split with stratification
Logistic Regression with class balancing

# Evaluation:
Classification report
Confusion matrix
ROC-AUC
ROC Curve plotting

# Insights for business application
# Results
Accuracy: 86%
ROC-AUC: 0.94 âœ… (excellent discrimination ability)
Recall (positive class): 0.90 (captures 90% of potential subscribers)

The model effectively identifies potential subscribers, making it practical for marketing campaign targeting and lead prioritization.

# Business Impact
Helps marketing teams prioritize contacting potential customers likely to subscribe.
Reduces missed opportunities by maintaining high recall while managing false positives effectively.
Supports data-driven decision-making in campaign resource allocation.

# Key Skills Demonstrated
Practical supervised machine learning pipeline
Handling imbalanced data
Data wrangling and visualization
Clear interpretation of model outputs for business decisions
